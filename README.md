## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library v18.2.0

### What I learned

I exploited this project to learn React architecture and I developed this project using the function components method. Also, I used some hooks like useState and useRef in addition to I applied  BEM methodology in CSS class name hierarchy.


### Continued development

I will learn more about React hooks and I'm looking forward to building the next project which should be able to handle APIs requests using the React library.
